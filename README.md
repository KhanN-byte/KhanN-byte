👋 Hi, I’m Haris 

Software Engineer — Python | C++ | Linux | Backend Systems 

I build backend and systems-oriented software using Python and C++, with an emphasis on correctness, performance, and maintainability. My work spans automation, API development, and low-level problem solving, complemented by experience with JavaScript and Salesforce (Apex / LWC). I prefer hands-on projects that deepen understanding of system behavior and turn practical problems into clean, reliable code.

Current Projects:

Password strength checker built using Python + C++, combining high-level validation with low-level performance and security concepts

Google SEO tooling using Python automation, focused on keyword analysis, ranking insights, and optimization workflows

Current Focus:

Linux / Ubuntu fundamentals

Python & C++ mini-projects (automation, systems, APIs)

ML / AI experimentation and tooling

Background:

5+ years in software engineering across web, backend, and CRM platforms

Salesforce Developer (multiple certifications)

Technical writer for In Plain English (Stackademic / Medium)
