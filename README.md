👋 Hi, I’m Haris — a Software Engineer focused on Python, C++, Linux, and backend systems.

I work primarily with Python 3 (automation, data analysis with NumPy/Pandas, APIs), C++ for systems-level and performance-oriented work, JavaScript, and Salesforce (Apex/LWC). I enjoy building small, focused projects to strengthen fundamentals, explore system behavior, and automate real-world problems.

Current focus

Linux / Ubuntu fundamentals

Python & C++ mini-projects (automation, systems, APIs)

ML / AI experimentation and tooling

Background

5+ years in software engineering across web, backend, and CRM platforms

Salesforce Developer (multiple certifications)

Technical writer for In Plain English (Stackademic / Medium)

Always open to collaboration on practical, learning-driven projects.
